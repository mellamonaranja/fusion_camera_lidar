## LiDAR-Camera Fusion Visualization

This visualization demonstrates the LiDAR-camera fusion result produced by `vis_point_cloud.ipynb`.

| Stage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7cb58bb-fdf8-4ac2-abc3-5b4864fd76a9) | **Raw point cloud (gray)** overlaid with **camera-detected objects (red)**  | 
| ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/35f6fb63-88f3-40c2-868b-2e7c2605841f) | **Semantic clustering** of detected objects, each color represents a separate object |
| ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e1e5414-cc89-469b-b357-c9d5c514e7e8) | **Temporal association** of objects with trajectory lines, showing fusion over time |

> This visualization helps assess alignment, object grouping, and multi-sensor tracking performance.
